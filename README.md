# Add Guest App

<li>This is a guest list organizing project with a responsive design.</li>
<li>The project has been made using React.</li>
<li>The app enables the user to organize a guest list via including new guests or deleting existing ones.</li>
<li>Things I have tried for the first time in this project include using a UUID and creating a popup screen.</li>
<li> The popup screen displays different error messages corresponding to the error occured in the input field.</li>
